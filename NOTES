Do we REALLY need the stream analysis?

WE NEED A COLLECTOR-REDUCE STRUCT IN RUST_SPP
WE NEED A STRUCT THAT LET'S US SEND MORE OUTPUTS THAN WE RECEIVE, TO MULTIPLE PLACES

LIMITATIONS:
	We can only send multiple tuples with a `for` loop in the very first stage.
	We can only "collect" the output with a stateful computation in the very last stage.

Ideas:
	It is better to improve rust_spp than to keep working on this.
	It is not necessary to have this extra level of abstraction.

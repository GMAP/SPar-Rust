* SPAR_NUM_WORKERS vs Replicate priority

Proc macros are run during the AST creation phase, prior to type analyzes.
This means we don't have acess to type information when are generating proc
macros' output. This makes it very difficult to work with rust-ssp, for example.

Do we REALLY need the stream analysis?

From Dalvan's thesis:
	* literals are not accepted as Input or Output
	* empty Input and Output are not accepted
	* replicate could be empty:
		Only if it is empty, we use SPAR_NUM_WORKERS
	* if replicate is not present, we always use 1

Organize repository with workspaces, and proper testing
	use quote to generate token streams we can use for testing

Code generation
	basic stream analysis (based on Dalvan's thesis)
	generate the actual code

MAYBE:
Add type information to Ident (user must write them)
	Ex: INPUT(a: u32, b: String)

From Dalvan's thesis:
	* replicate could be empty:
		Only if it is empty, we use SPAR_NUM_WORKERS
	* if replicate is not present, we always use 1

we can use quote to generate token streams we can use for testing

Code generation
	basic stream analysis (based on Dalvan's thesis)
	generate the actual code

MAYBE:
Add type information to Ident (user must write them)
	Ex: INPUT(a: u32, b: String)

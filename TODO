Problem:
	we have a problem with the codegen
	we need to store STAGES source location information in order to generate code correctly
	right now, STAGES is always being printed at the end, which is leading to annoying problems

Change SparStream code and stage representation
	There can be code after the STAGE:
		to_stream!({
			while(something) {
				let a = 1;
				STAGE(INPUT(a) ({ ...}))
			} // <= THIS NEEDS TO BE PARSED!!
		})

MAYBE:
Add type information to Ident (user must write them)
	Ex: INPUT(a: u32, b: String)
